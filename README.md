FastTD3 is a high-performance variant of the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, optimized for complex humanoid control tasks. FastTD3 can solve various humanoid control tasks with dexterous hands from HumanoidBench in just a few hours of training. Furthermore, FastTD3 achieves similar or better wall-time-efficiency to PPO in high-dimensional control tasks from popular simulations such as IsaacLab and MuJoCo Playground.

## ❗ Updates

- **[Sep/17/2025]** Fixed an issue where `std_min` and `std_max` were not included in Actor config (credit: [@ningyuanz](https://github.com/ningyuanz)).

- **[Aug/07/2025]** If you encounter an issue in reproducing the performance, try disabling `torch.compile`. Please use `--no_compile` in argument.

- **[Jul/07/2025]** Added support for multi-GPU training! See [Multi-GPU Training](#multi-gpu-training) section for details. 

- **[Jul/02/2025]** Optimized codebase to speed up training around 10-30% when using a single RTX 4090 GPU.

- **[Jun/20/2025]** Added support for [MTBench](https://github.com/Viraj-Joshi/MTBench) with the help of [Viraj Joshi](https://viraj-joshi.github.io/).

- **[Jun/15/2025]** Added support for FastTD3 + [SimbaV2](https://dojeon-ai.github.io/SimbaV2/)! It's faster to train, and often achieves better asymptotic performance. We recommend using FastTD3 + SimbaV2 for most cases.

- **[Jun/06/2025]** Thanks to [Antonin Raffin](https://araffin.github.io/) ([@araffin](https://github.com/araffin)), we fixed the issues when using `n_steps` > 1, which stabilizes training with n-step return quite a lot!

- **[Jun/01/2025]** Updated the figures in the technical report to report deterministic evaluation for IsaacLab tasks.


## ✨ Features

FastTD3 offers researchers a significant speedup in training complex humanoid agents.

- Ready-to-go codebase with detailed instructions and pre-configured hyperparameters for each task
- Support popular benchmarks: HumanoidBench, MuJoCo Playground, and IsaacLab
- User-friendly features that can accelerate your research, such as rendering rollouts, torch optimizations (AMP and compile), and saving and loading checkpoints

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Conda (for environment management)
- Git LFS (Large File Storage) -- For IsaacLab
- CMake -- For IsaacLab

And the following system packages:
```bash
sudo apt install libglfw3 libgl1-mesa-glx libosmesa6 git-lfs cmake
```

## 📖 Installation

This project requires different Conda environments for different sets of experiments.

### Common Setup
First, ensure the common dependencies are installed as mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

### Environment for HumanoidBench

```bash
conda create -n fasttd3_hb -y python=3.10
conda activate fasttd3_hb
pip install --editable git+https://github.com/carlosferrazza/humanoid-bench.git#egg=humanoid-bench
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

### Environment for MuJoCo Playground
```bash
conda create -n fasttd3_playground -y python=3.10
conda activate fasttd3_playground
pip install -r requirements/requirements_playground.txt
```

**⚠️ Note:** Our `requirements_playground.txt` specifies `Jax==0.4.35`, which we found to be stable for latest GPUs in certain tasks such as `LeapCubeReorient` or `LeapCubeRotateZAxis`

**⚠️ Note:** Current FastTD3 codebase uses customized MuJoCo Playground that supports saving last observations into info dictionary. We will work on incorporating this change into official repository hopefully soon.

### Environment for IsaacLab
```bash
conda create -n fasttd3_isaaclab -y python=3.10
conda activate fasttd3_isaaclab

# Install IsaacLab (refer to official documentation for the latest steps)
# Official Quickstart: https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/quickstart.html
pip install 'isaacsim[all,extscache]==4.5.0' --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
git clone https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab.git
cd IsaacLab
./isaaclab.sh --install
cd ..

# Install project-specific requirements
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

### Environment for MTBench
MTBench does not support humanoid experiments, but is a useful multi-task benchmark with massive parallel simulation. This could be useful for users who want to use FastTD3 for their multi-task experiments.

```bash
conda create -n fasttd3_mtbench -y python=3.8  # Note python version
conda activate fasttd3_mtbench

# Install IsaacGym -- recommend to follow instructions in https://github.com/BoosterRobotics/booster_gym
...

# Install MTBench
git clone https://github.com/Viraj-Joshi/MTBench.git
cd MTbench
pip install -e .
pip install skrl
cd ..

# Install project-specific requirements
pip install -r requirements/requirements_isaacgym.txt
```

### (Optional) Accelerate headless GPU rendering in cloud instances

In some cloud VM images the NVIDIA kernel driver is present but the user-space OpenGL/EGL/Vulkan libraries aren't, so MuJoCo falls back to CPU renderer. You can install just the NVIDIA user-space libraries (and skip rebuilding the kernel module) with:

```bash
sudo apt install -y kmod
sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-<your_driver_version>.run -s --no-kernel-module --ui=none --no-questions
```

As a rule-of-thumb, if you're running experiments and rendering is taking longer than 5 seconds, it is very likely that GPU renderer is not used.

## 🚀 Running Experiments

Activate the appropriate Conda environment before running experiments.

Please see `fast_td3/hyperparams.py` for information regarding hyperparameters!

**Quick note:** For boolean-based arguments, you can set them to False by adding `no_` in front each argument, for instance, if you want to disable Clipped Q Learning, you can specify `--no_use_cdq` in your command.

## 💡 Performance-Related Tips

We used a single Nvidia A100 80GB GPU for all experiments. Here are some remarks and tips for improving performances in your setup or troubleshooting in your machine configurations.

- *Sample-efficiency* tends to improve with larger `num_envs`, `num_updates`, and `batch_size`. But this comes at the cost of *Time-efficiency*. Our default settings are optimized for wall-time efficiency on a single A100 80GB GPU. If you're using a different setup, consider tuning hyperparameters accordingly.
- When FastTD3 performance is stuck at local minima at the early phase of training in your experiments
  - First consider increasing the `num_updates`. This happens usually when the agent fails to exploit value functions. We also find higher `num_updates` tends to be helpful for relatively easier tasks or tasks with low-dimensional action spaces.
  - If the agent is completely stuck or much worse than your expectation, try using `num_steps=3` or disabling `use_cdq`.
  - For tasks that have penalty reward terms (e.g., torques, energy, action_rate, ..), consider lowering them for initial experiments, and tune the values. In some cases, curriculum learning with lower penalty terms followed by fine-tuning with stronger terms is effective.
- When you encounter out-of-memory error with your GPU, our recommendation for reducing GPU usage is (i) smaller `buffer_size`, (ii) smaller `batch_size`, and then (iii) smaller `num_envs`. Because our codebase is assigning the whole replay buffer in GPU to reduce CPU-GPU transfer bottleneck, it usually has the largest GPU consumption, but usually less harmful to reduce.
- Consider using `--compile_mode max-autotune` if you plan to run for many training steps. This may speed up training by up to 10% at the cost of a few additional minutes of heavy compilation.

## Multi-GPU Training
We support multi-GPU training. If your machine supports multiple GPUs, or specify multiple GPUs using `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, and run `train_multigpu.py`, it will automatically use all GPUs to scale up training.

**Important:** Our multi-GPU implementation launches the **same experiment independently on each GPU** rather than distributing parameters across GPUs. This means:
- Effective number of environments: `num_envs × num_gpus`
- Effective batch size: `batch_size × num_gpus` 
- Effective buffer size: `buffer_size × num_gpus`

Each GPU runs a complete copy of the training process, which scales up data collection and training throughput proportionally to the number of GPUs.

For instance, running IsaacLab experiments with 4 GPUs and `num_envs=1024` will end up in similar results as experiments with 1 GPU with `num_envs=4096`.

## 🛝 Playing with the FastTD3 training

A Jupyter notebook (`training_notebook.ipynb`) is available to help you get started with:
- Training FastTD3 agents.
- Loading pre-trained models.
- Visualizing agent behavior.
- Potentially, re-training or fine-tuning models.
